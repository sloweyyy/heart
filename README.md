### CSS Styles

The CSS styles define the appearance and layout of the animation, including the pink heart shape and its animation using keyframes.

### JavaScript Code

The JavaScript code initializes and controls the particle animation. It includes classes for managing particles, creating the heart shape, and rendering the animation on the canvas.

### Canvas Rendering

The animation is rendered on the canvas element with the ID "pinkboard." It dynamically creates particle images and continuously updates and draws them on the canvas.
